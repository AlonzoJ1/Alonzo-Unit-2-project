                Chicago experienced major elevates in truculent malefaction in the 1920s, in the tardy 1960s, and in the 2020s. a decline in overall malefaction in the 2000s, and then an ascension in murders in 2016. Murder, rape, and larceny are prevalent truculent malefactions in the city, and the occurrences of such incidents are documented by the Chicago Police Department and indexed in annual malefaction reports.

                After adopting malefaction-fighting techniques in 2004 that were recommended by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Incipient York City Police Department, Chicago recorded 448 homicides, the lowest total since 1965. This murder rate of 15.65 per 100,000 population was still above the U.S. average, an average which takes in many minuscule towns and suburbs.

                By 2010, Chicago's homicide rate had surpassed that of Los Angeles (16.02 per 100,000), and was more than twice that of Incipient York City (7.0 per 100,000). By the cessation of 2015, Chicago's homicide rate rose to 18.6 per 100,000. By 2016, Chicago had recorded more homicides and shooting victims than Incipient York City and Los Angeles amalgamated. By the terminus of 2020, Chicago's homicide rate rose to 28 per 100,000.

                Chicago's most immensely colossal malefactor equity challenges have transmuted little over the last 50 years, and statistically reside with homicide, armed larceny, gang violence, and aggravated battery.

                Chicago has an estimated population of over 100,000 active gang members from proximately 60 factions. Gang warfare and retaliation is mundane in Chicago. Gangs were responsible for 61% of the homicides in Chicago in 2011.

                Former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy incriminates Chicago's gang culture for its high rates of homicide and other bellicose malefaction, verbally expressing "It's very frustrating to ken that it's like 7% of the population causes 80% of the truculent malefaction...The gangs here are traditional gangs that are generational, if you will. The grandfather was a gang member, the father's a gang member, and the kid right now is going to be a gang member."

                Mayor Rahm Emanuel disbanded the Chicago Police Department's anti-gang unit in 2012 in order to fixate on beat patrols, which he verbally expressed would have a more long-term solution to violence than anti-gang units.

                As many as 70 active and dormant Chicago street gangs with 753 factions have been identified. Some of the gangs that contribute most of the malefaction on the streets of Chicago:
                Gangster Disciples,Vice Lords,Ebony P. Stones,Latin Kings,Ebony Disciples,Maniac Latin Disciples,Spanish Cobras,Almighty Saints,Spanish Gangster Disciples
                Four Corner Hustlers
                Detailed analysis of the homicides timeline by month show that homicides (of all races) went up right after Martin Luther King was killed in 1968 (still for reasons unknown). However, Hispanic-on-Hispanic homicides, did not eminently start until the summer of 1971, due to the Latin Kings gang election meetings. However, this claim can't be immediately proven, as homicides by race are not made public for those time periods.

                The city of Chicago has one of the highest murder rates among immensely colossal cities. Despite generally rigorous gun laws compared to neighboring areas, there are still many illicit guns in Chicago. It is estimated that 80% of homicides in Chicago are committed with firearms. Chicago recorded 780 murders in 2020. This figure represents an incrementation of more than 55% over 2019. On the Fourth of July weekend 2021, at least 100 people, mostly African-American, were shot, 18 of them fatally. Murders for 2021, are trending higher than 2020.

                Chicago has a proscription on guns designated as "assault weapons" and laser sights. Adscititiously, under Illinois law, to own a firearm one must possess a firearms owners’ identification (FOID) card, undergo a background check, and wait 72 hours afore taking possession of a purchased firearm. Lost or glommed guns must withal be reported to law enforcement within 72 hours. There are currently no gun stores in the Chicago city limits, albeit facile access to guns is likely occurring via neighboring Indiana and the many other areas with different gun laws.

                About 7000 guns are recuperated by Chicago police each year at malefaction scenes. An estimated 45% of these guns are bought by straw buyers in states with lax gun laws, namely Indiana. In April 2021, the City of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Westforth Sports of Gary Indiana, alleging that it consistently ranks as one of the highest suppliers of guns utilized in malefactions. The city claims that during the period from 2009 to 2016, 850 recuperated guns were pristinely purchased from Westforth Sports.<br>
